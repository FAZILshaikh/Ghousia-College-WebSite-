                    <p>The Department of Computer science and engineering started in the year 1986, with the total
                        intake of 60 students, now the intake has been increased to 90. The department has dedicated
                        teaching and non teaching faculty.

                        The p
                    <p>TThe department of Electronics and Communication Engineering at Ghousia College of Engineering
                        was started during the year 1985, and has an intake of 120 students every year. The B.E program
                        is approved by AICTE and Government of Karnataka,and affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological
                        University (VTU), Belgaum, accredited by NBA. The main aim of the department is to provide the
                        quality education in the field of Electronics and Communication Engineering, as the global scene
                        is exposed to new & Recent emerging technologies especially in Communication, VLSI subsystems
                        and embedded technologies. The 21st century is the century of knowledge and technical shifts.
                        The paradigm shift in technology is the growing need of learners and the society in particular.
                        Hence the Management of Ghousia Industrial and Engineering Trust rightly decided to expose the
                        changes, the society of today is made to acquaint.<br>

                        The department of Electronics and Communication has separate laboratories well equipped with the
                        latest equipments and satisfying curriculum requirements of Visvasvaraya Technical University
                        and AICTE New Delhi. The faculties are well qualified and there is lot of enthusiasm amongst
                        them to go for research which we feel is not far away from our dreams. As such the Management is
                        very keen to promote avenues to the faculty to take up research work to their advantage and
                        benefit from learning. The department has started IEEE students’ branch of GCE in the year 2006
                        and the centre of Excellency in VLSI in 2010. The Department has received Rs. 10.26 lakhs for
                        modernizing the VLSI design and Microcontroller Lab under MODROBS schemes from AICTE in the year
                        2007 Rs. 8.6 lakhs for modernizing the Digital Signal Processing Lab under MODROBS schemes from
                        AICTE in the year 2009.<br><br>

                        The staff are deputed to attend seminar / workshops etc to update their knowledge, apart from
